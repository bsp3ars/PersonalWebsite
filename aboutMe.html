				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Brandon Spears, and I am currently 16 years old. I am currently a junior in the Game
					Programming and Web Applications class at
					Miami Valley Career Technology Center. I am also a student at Sinclair Community College, as
					well as Clark State Community College. My
					home school is Tipp City Exempted Village Schools, and one of my greatest hobbies is computers
					(and anything involving them). My other hobbies
					include swimming, basketball, and video games. I do my best to keep myself busy, with my job at
					Taco Bell, to the AP Classes at MVCTC, to the
					extracurricular college classes that I also take. I also like to go above and beyond what is
					necessary to improve my knowledge and understanding
					of everything important.
