	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Brandon Spears, and I am currently 16 years old. I am currently a junior in the Game 
		Programming and Web Applications class at 
		Miami Valley Career Technology Center. I am also a student at Sinclair Community College, as 
		well as Clark State Community College. My 
		home school is Tipp City Exempted Village Schools, and one of my greatest hobbies is computers
		 (and anything involving them). My other hobbies
		include swimming, basketball, and video games. I do my best to keep myself busy, with my job at
		 Taco Bell, to the AP Classes at MVCTC, to the 
		extracurricular college classes that I also take. I also like to go above and beyond what is
		 necessary to improve my knowledge and understanding
		of everything important. </p>
