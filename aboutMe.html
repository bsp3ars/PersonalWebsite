	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Brandon Spears, and I am currently 16 years old. I am currently a junior in the Game Programming and Web Applications class at 
		Miami Valley Career Technology Center. I am also a student at Sinclair Community College, as well as Clark State Community College. My 
		home school is Tipp City Exempted Village Schools, and one of my greatest hobbies is computers (and anything involving them). My other hobbies
		include swimming, basketball, and video games. I do my best to keep myself busy, with my job at Taco Bell, to the AP Classes at MVCTC, to the 
		extracurricular college classes that I also take. I also like to go above and beyond what is necessary to improve my knowledge and understanding
		of everything important. </p>

	<h2>Family</h2>
	<p>My family consists of my father George Spears, my mother Lori Spears, my brother Jason Spears, and my dog Buddy, who is a black-lab mix.
		My father is a computer salesman of sorts who works for Oracle Corporation, one of the biggest computer companies in the world.
		My mother is a substitute teacher, as well as the assistant for Mrs. Evelyn Staub, the owner of Gallery 14 in Tipp City. My brother is 
		a middle school student at Tippecanoe Middle School. Buddy is about 4 and a half years old now, and was adopted from the pound. </p>
