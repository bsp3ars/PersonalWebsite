	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>	It is a very unique place that has a lot of projects (maybe) that I have created.
		Despite all of the issues that I have encountered, I will continue on my path toward greatness.</p>

	<h2>Educational Goals</h2>
		<p>
		To develop two SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reasonable, and Timely) goals,
		you have to be able to determine what it is that you want for a goal. My first goal
		that I want to achieve is to practice my HTML skills by continuously improving my 
		site at least once every two months (or six times a year). The second SMART goal is 
		to be about my personal work ethic. I am going to spend at least an hour a week studying
		and reviewing my previous courses and information that I have covered.

	<h2>Employment Goals</h2>
		<p>
		My current employment goal after college is to become an experienced software designer. I am currently
		learning many skills in my college classes at Sinclair, as well as at MVCTC in the Game Programming class.

	<p>I love going above and beyond what is required (we haven't learned pictures yet, will update the image later).</p>
