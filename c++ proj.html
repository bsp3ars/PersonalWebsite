						<td> Adventure Game </td>
						<td> The adventure game is a C++ game designed to make you go through a story line in order to
						complete it.It has many different options and is very unique compared to other Adventure
						Games made by my classmates.I chose it because it was a culmintaion of all of my learned
						material as a C++ Programmer at the time of completion, as well as the pinnacle of my
						first semester in the class. If I were to improve upon it, I would increase its length,
						as well as the topic would be more diverse. </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> BMI Calculator </td>
						<td> The BMI Calculator is a C++ designed tool that can easily help you determin your BMI, and what your recommended
						caloric intake is. I chose it becuase it is applicable to almost everyone who will look at this site.
						It has the options for male and female, as well as the option for whether you are active or inactive. If
						I were to do anything different, it would have a better introduction title, or be more user friendly.
						It took about half an hour to create, and shows some of the progress that I have made in my class at MVCTC. </td>
