				The adventure game is a C++ game designed to make you go through a story line in order to 
				complete it.It has many different options and is very unique compared to other Adventure
				 Games made by my classmates.I chose it because it was a culmintaion of all of my learned
				  material as a C++ Programmer at the time of completion, as well as the pinnacle of my 
				  first semester in the class. If I were to improve upon it, I would increase its length,
				   as well as the topic would be more diverse.

		This is the image of the adventure game when you run it. It lasts about 5 minutes and is a good time
		 consumer. If you would like to download it, then click <a href="projects/AGame.zip" >here</a> to download it.
		  After you download it, then you have to unzip it. If you need help unzipping it, then check
